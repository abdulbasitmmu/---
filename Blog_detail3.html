		<h1>Performance and <br><br>Optimisation</h1>
        <br>
		<p>There are two factors that helps to develop the website and those factors are known as

performance and optimisation. The performance of the website is based on the loading time

and its computability with different browsers and the experiences of the user. This website

portfolio was developed with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It I the light language

that keeps the website light and does not require fast load time. The pictures and graphics and

its uses was focused to a minimum and this way, the size does not exceed about the website

and this quickly load the website. (Siotos, 2013)
</p>
<p>
The website was formed in term the navigation could be easier for strong level of user

experience. The font and colour were also light in colour to ignore the vision based

challenges. The website portfolio was tested for different errors that might create with the

incompatibility of browser. The testing of the website was done on Safari, Google Chrome

and Mozilla and different tools and the performance related challenges were resolved

accordingly. The website portfolio was optimised with the help of proper keywords. (Devine

websites, 2017)

<p>
<strong>Validation of code:</strong> When there is coding done by the programmers, they leave the open tags

and incomplete navigation tabs. This generates the challenges while searching and focus on

scanning the website for particular information and appropriate keywords. This way, it can

rank the website successfully. There is a validation of code on the validator tool called as

W3C that resolves all the errors. This helps to understand there are no links that are broken

and there could have index in every page for the appropriate keywords. (thegrowthstory.in,

2017)

</p>
<p>
Optimization of page: There is a relevance of keywords to every page that were looked for

the page curriculum vitae such as IT consultant candidate in London who was BTec graduate

were looked and implemented with the help of different tags such as title, description and alt

tags. This helps to index the URL of the page that could help in the search engines. Different

search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing can read the website text along with the

codes. The use of alt tag help to deal with the images while scanning the images that can read

the keywords within the alt tag.
</p>

<h3>Integration of SEO</h3>

<p>The content of the website was proofread for grammar and spelling

challenges. The appropriated keywords were found in every page with the Google keyword

planner that were involved into the Title. Alt and description of every page. To develop the

links, social media links were posted on the website. This works as the backlinks that are

important to increase the page and the authority of the domain. </p>
<p>Social media also increases the website fuel and it involves the best content that can be

exchanged successfully. There were fresh and best articles and blogs written for grammar and

uploaded on the blog of the website. The articles are developed with keywords and it helps to

develop the search engines and ranking. Different blogs were uploaded to develop the content

and this increases the website keywords. (Freewayprojects.com, 2016)
