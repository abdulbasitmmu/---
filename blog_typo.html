		<h1>Typography</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Rules of Implementation</h4>
		<br>
        <p> There are two types of typography– expressive typography (type is visual, carries the meaning of the word and sometimes appears as physical shapes) and functional typography (type that is meant to be read). Lets briefly summarise the implementation of functional typography in here. </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is best to learn the fundamentals of good design:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Hierarchy (primary, secondary and tertiary reads)</li>
 <li> Flow (how a person “reads” the layout by following the movement of their attention)</li> 
 <li> Legibility (in Western culture, type is read top to bottom, left to right so it’s important to arrange type accordingly)</li> 
 <li> Grouping (organizing blocks of type in intelligent and logical groups) and interest</li> 
 <li> Achieved through contrast (scale, texture, color, density, negative space)</li>
 </ul>

        <p>Every conceivable feature of typography can be referred to by its name. Whether  talking about the typeface itself, or the arrangement of type within a layout, there's a huge glossary of terms which can help describe things properly. Let's take a look at the elements of typography which are important to, as a web designer.
        </p>
        <p>There are two essential aspects of typography which directly concern web designers:        </p>

        <ul class="sdf">
        <li>Influence due to choice of typeface</li> 
       <li> Manipulate through CSS</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The rules under which we designed the pages of the website are listed one by one. They are:-</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Text Alignment - Flush left : </strong>
			The text is aligned along the left margin or gutter, also known as left-aligned, ragged right or ranged left. People generally read from top to bottom and left to right. 
			By justifying left, the eye is able to find the edge and read copy more easily. Indentation of first line of a paragraph should be avoided.
            Left-aligned text is favourable because it follows the reader’s natural optical patterns.

	<!--	<img src="img/blog/blog1-1.png" class="responsive" id="first">-->
        <p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Use One Font :</strong> 
		Most typefaces can be classified into one of four basic groups: those with serifs, those without serifs, scripts and decorative styles. Over the years, typographers and scholars of typography have devised various systems to more definitively categorize typefaces – some of these systems have scores of sub-categories.
        A classification system can be helpful in identifying, choosing and combining typefaces. 
		 Using two fonts succesfully with a layout requires an understanding of the chosen fonts in order to be confident that they are complimentary. In general, avoid using two fonts of same classification. The font used here is Helvetica Neue.</p>

                <p><strong>Rule 3</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Skip a Weight : </strong>
		The font-weight property sets the weight, or thickness, of a font and is dependent either on available font faces within a font family or weights defined by the browser.
		Transition from light to bold or medium to extra bold when changing font weights a great design. It imparts contrasts. Using bold for the headline and light for the body provides greater contrast. The font weight used here is normal and bold. Headings are usually bold and with regards to the content of the site, usage of normal provides better readability and contrast.</p>

        <p><strong>Rule 4</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Double Point Size : </strong>When changing font sizes, a good rule of thumb is to double or half the point size. In this, we started from 12.5px to 25px and then the headlines in respective 50px and 75px. We followed the pattern of 0.5X, 1X, 2X, 3X.</p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Rule 5</strong></p>


		<p><strong>Align to one Axis : </strong>One should type along the primary axis. Either stick to left or stick to right. In case of horizontal axis. alignment must be on the strongest horizontal element. Sometimes this is the best cap height while the others are baseline. We have maintained the rule of keeping left or keeping right.</p>

        <br>
                <p><strong>Rule 6</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Group by Using Rules : </strong>Make an association of similar objects in a orderly manner. This helps to show the relevant information based on group realated blocks of object. The same thing is applied in animations, where the animation ranged from 0.2s to 1.2s. The rule of division by 0.5 or multiplication by 2 was maintained to make a group of animations.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs become much more legible when they are short and sweet. Breaking up key thoughts into groupings of sentences makes  content approachable and digestible for readers.</p>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Rule 7</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Avoid the corners : </strong>Never place the elements along the edge or corners of a page since it cuts the elements off. Having negative space is good since it provides oxygen to design to let it breathe. The use of paddings, margins and chunking the code in containers helped to avoid the corners.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><strong>Rule 8</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Mind the Gap : </strong> Spacing is the main aspect in Typography. The use of forced type which either way is justified or having a single word in the paragraph. This all makes the presentation a widow. Using a single space after punctuation and paying details to the shape and removing undesired shapes/angles. Shaping matters. The closer the things are, the more the reader makes a connection. One should not allow a new page or column as it leaves the page as an orphan.

        <p><strong>Rule 9</strong></p>

        <p><strong> Never be Regular: </strong> Be either bold or italic but never be regular. The concept of this generates much user readability and enhances user persistence on reading and retaining the matter. It introduces the contrast which causes the soothen effect or we say a calm effect.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The typography of a website plays an integral role in the user experience of a site–just as much as other elements such as navigation, color palette and use of images do. Fortunately, when it comes to formatting copy, the use of items such as typefaces can draw from a rich heritage in print and graphic design, which has been an evolving discipline for the last century or so. And when it comes to combining fonts, there are several best practices that have evolved out of the collective experience of the design community, taking the guesswork out of implementing effective typography on the Web.</p>
        <p>The possibilities for typography on the web are virtually endless, but my hope is that I’ve armed you with some basic tips and tricks for harnessing this powerful medium of communication.</p>
